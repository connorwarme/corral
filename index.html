        <h2>Corral Privacy Policy</h2>
        <h3>Effective Date: May 20, 2025</h3>
        <p>
          This Privacy Policy describes how Decode Solutions LLC ("we," "us," or
          "our") handles information in connection with your use of the Corral
          mobile application (the "App").
        </p>
        <h3>Our Commitment to Your Privacy</h3>
        <p>
          Your privacy is important to us. Corral is designed to provide users
          with a seamless way to organize and share trips, as well as find
          nearby friends and recommended events. We are committed to protecting
          the limited information we collect and ensuring transparency about our
          practices.
        </p>
        <h3>Information We Collect</h3>
        <p>
          We want to be clear: Corral does not collect any personal data from
          you beyond what you explicitly provide to us through the App's
          functionalities.
        </p>
        <p>
          The information we collect is directly provided by you when you use
          specific features within the App:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <p>
              <em>Account Information:</em> When you create an account, you
              provide us with information such as your name, email address, and
              password. This information is used solely to create and manage
              your account and to allow you to log in to the App.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              <em>Trip/Event Information:</em> When you create, modify, or
              interact with trips, events, or similar features within the App,
              you may provide details such as trip names, dates, locations,
              descriptions, and participant information. This information is
              stored to enable the App's core functionality for you and your
              designated participants.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              <em>User-Generated Content:</em> Any other content you explicitly
              create or input into the App (e.g., notes, photos, comments) is
              stored to fulfill the App's functionality.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              <em>Contact Information (Optional):</em> If you choose to invite
              friends or share content within the App using your device's
              contacts, we may temporarily access your contacts only for the
              purpose of enabling you to select specific contacts for sharing,
              and we do not store your contact list on our servers.
            </p>
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h3>How We Use Your Information</h3>
        <p>
          We use the information you provide exclusively for the following
          purposes:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <p>

          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              <em>To Enable App Functionality:</em> To allow you to interact
              with other users if the App supports multi-user features (e.g.,
              sharing trips with friends you invite).
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              <em>For Communication Related to the App:</em> To send you
              essential service-related communications, such as password reset
              instructions or critical updates about the App.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>

              linked back to you) for internal analysis to understand how our
              App is used and to improve its features and performance.
            </p>
          </li>
        </ul>
        <h3>How We Share Your Information</h3>

        <ul>
          <li>
            <p>
              <em>With Other Users (at your direction):</em> If you use App
              features that involve sharing information with other users (e.g.,
              inviting friends to a trip), the information you choose to share
              will be accessible to those users.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              <em>With Third-Party Service Providers:</em> We may use
              third-party service providers to facilitate our App's operation
              (e.g., hosting providers, database services). These providers are
              contractually obligated to protect your information and use it
              only for the purposes for which we disclose it to them.
            </p>
            <!-- <p>
            Example if using third-party analytics: "We use [e.g., Firebase
            Analytics, Google Analytics] to understand how users interact with our

            data, and crash reports. For more information on how [e.g., Firebase,

          <li>
            <p>
              <em>For Legal Reasons:</em> We may disclose your information if
              required to do so by law or in the good faith belief that such
              action is necessary to comply with legal obligations, protect and
              defend our rights or property, or prevent fraud or illegal
              activity.

          Your data is stored on secure servers maintained by our third-party
          hosting provider AWS. We implement reasonable technical and
          organizational measures to protect your information from unauthorized
          access, alteration, disclosure, or destruction. However, no method of
